## 🌦️ Welcome to Our Weather Wonderland!

Hello, young meteorologists and web explorers! 🌟 Are you ready to dive into the fascinating world of weather forecasting? The SunnySideForecast project is your golden ticket to understanding how weather predictions are made and displayed on a website. Not only will you learn about the weather, but you'll also get hands-on experience with web development! 🌐🌪️

## 📚 What's on the Forecast?

This exciting project is more than just predicting if you'll need an umbrella tomorrow; it's about creating a fully functional weather forecast website. Here's what we'll cover:

### HTML: The Blueprint of Our Website

- **Basic Structure**: Start with the basics of HTML, including setting up the `<!DOCTYPE html>` and understanding the `html`, `head`, and `body` tags.
- **Divisions**: Learn how to organize your content using `<div>` tags, creating a clean and structured layout.
- **Images & Text**: Add flair to your website with `<img>` tags for weather icons and `<p>`, `<h1>`, and `<h2>` tags for text information.
- **Search Bar**: Incorporate a search feature with a simple design to explore different locations' weather.

### CSS: Styling Our Forecast

- **Styling**: Use CSS to bring life to our webpage with background colors, font styles, and more, all imported from Google Fonts.
- **Flexbox**: Arrange your weather cards and other elements neatly with CSS Flexbox, ensuring a responsive and attractive layout.
- **Responsive Design**: Make your website look great on any device, teaching you the principles of responsive web design through media queries.
